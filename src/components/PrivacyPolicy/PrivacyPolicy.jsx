            <b>User Provided Information:</b> You may provide to SELF what is
            generally called “personally identifiable” information, such as your
            name and e-mail address, when you register, email us, or when you
            make a purchase from the SELF Site. In addition, SELF may give you
            the option to provide us with certain demographic information about
            yourself, to upload photographs or other personally identifiable
            information about you, and to allow us to determine your physical
            location. Unless you voluntarily provide or send us personally
            identifiable or location information, we will always ask your
            permission before collecting your personally identifiable or
            location information. If you choose not to allow the collection of
            your personally identifiable information [then you will not be able
            to receive the full experience from SELF.. If you provide or submit
            your personally identifiable or location information to us we will
            provide you with the ability to review, update and/or delete your
            personally identifiable or location information, subject to our
            obligations to comply with legal, regulatory, internal audit and
            record-keeping requirements. To update and/or delete your personally
            identifiable or location information you have on file with us,
            please send an email to Hello@selfplatform.io.

          <p>
            <b>“Automatically Collected” Information:</b> When you visit the
            SELF Site or open one of our HTML emails, we may record certain
            information from your web browser by using different types of
            technology, including “clear gifs” or “web beacons.” This
            “automatically collected” information may include your Internet
            Protocol address (“IP Address”), web browser type, the web pages or
            sites that you visit just before or just after the SELF Site, the
            pages you view on our site, and the dates and times that you visit.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>“Cookies” Information:</b> We and our operational service
            providers and others who host the SELF Site often use technology
            that can recognize, collect and/or transmit information that is
            associated with the device you use to access and otherwise interact
            with the SELF Site. Although the term “cookie” specifically refers
            to a small text file that is stored on a User’s computer for
            record-keeping purposes, we use the term “cookie” to refer
            generically to any technology that can recognize, collect and/or
            transmit information about your visits to the SELF Site. This type
            of information includes such data as the Internet or web domain that
            referred you, the type of operating system and browser you are
            using, the date and time of your visit, data relating to activities
            on the SELF Site (e.g., so-called ‘clickstream’ data) and other
            technological attributes about your visit to the SELF Site. This
            information is used to analyze trends, administer the SELF Site,
            track user movements on the SELF Site, and gather aggregate
            demographic information about visitors so we can continually improve
            the SELF Site. Cookies also allow the SELF Site to recognize your
            computer or access device each time you visit and cookies can keep
            count of how often you return. Cookies can also track how you use
            the SELF Site and your preferences for features and functions, and
            cookies can store information such as your user name and password so
            that you don’t have to re-enter them each time you return to visit.
          </p>

          <p>
            When you visit the SELF Site, we may send one or more cookies – a
            small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to
            your computer. SELF uses both session cookies and persistent
            cookies. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser
            and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the SELF
            Site. By using these cookies, we can “remember” what you have done
            on the SELF Site before and personalize our site for you. These
            persistent types of cookies can be removed. You can disable or turn
            the cookie feature off by changing the settings on your Internet
            browser and you can also change the settings to stop your browser
            from automatically accepting cookies. Each web browser implements
            different functionality, so please refer to the manuals or technical
            support resources that are available in conjunction with your web
            browser to learn the correct way to modify your cookies set-up. If
            you are using the SELF Site in a jurisdiction where your prior
            consent is required for us to deploy any particular cookies, you
            will be asked to accept such cookies before they are deployed.
            Please note that disabling cookies or declining to accept certain
            cookies will prevent you from accessing some of the functionality
            and site offerings available via the SELF Site, and may also require
            you to re-enter certain information each time you visit or attempt
            to use the SELF Site.

          <p>
            SELF uses the information that we collect to provide to you all of
            the features and services found on the SELF Site. We may use your
            email address for marketing purposes, unless you have expressly
            notified us that you prefer for us not to use your email address for
            any specific marketing purposes ("opt-out"). Where required by
            applicable law, we will seek your prior consent to use your email
            for marketing purposes. While you may opt-out (or withhold consent,
            as applicable) from such marketing use, you may not opt-out from our
            use of your email address for non-marketing or administrative
            purposes such as automatic notifications of recent account activity,
            or notifying you of major site updates.
          </p>

          <p>
            SELF may use all of the information that we collect from our Users
            to (a) respond to User requests or inquiries, (b) complete User
            purchases, (c) improve our customer service, (d) provided customer
            support, (e) administer a contest, promotion, survey or other
            feature, (f) send Users periodic communications, news or other
            updates, (g) understand usage trends and preferences, (h) improve
            the way the SELF Site works and looks, (i) improve our marketing and
            promotional efforts, and (j) create new features and functionality.

          <p>
            As part of this process, we may use Google Analytics (or a similar
            service) to provide us with aggregated information about how Users
            interact with the SELF Site, and may set cookies and/or use web
            beacons for this purpose. The information gathered by the Google
            Analytics software (including any personally identifiable
            information about you) will be sent to Google where it will be
            stored and used by Google in accordance with its own privacy policy
            rather than ours. Please review the Google Privacy Policy

            may be located in a country, state, province or other jurisdiction
            that is different from the jurisdiction where you are located. By
            using the SELF Site, you consent to our transfer of that information
            to such other jurisdictions; if you are located outside the United
            States, your consent includes your consent to our transfer and

            SELF Site; (b) provide custom, personalized advertisements, content
            and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our marketing

            parties in the course of using the SELF Site. We cannot, and do not,
            guarantee the effectiveness of the security systems and procedures

            If SELF learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to
            notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate
            protective steps. By using the SELF Site or providing personally
            identifiable information to us, you agree that we can communicate

            you have provided to us in these circumstances. Depending on where
            you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security

          <p>
            A California privacy law that went into effect on January 1, 2005,
            the "Shine the Light" law, allows California residents to obtain a
            list of third parties to whom a business has disclosed personal
            information if it shares such information with third parties for
            their direct marketing purposes. However, if a business adopts and
            discloses in its privacy policy a policy of not disclosing
            customers’ personal information to third parties for their direct
            marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to
            the disclosure, the business may comply with the law by notifying
            the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of personal
            information and by providing a cost-free means to exercise that
            right.
          </p>

          <p>
            As stated earlier in this Privacy Policy, personal information
            submitted at the time of registration or submission may be used for
            marketing and promotional purposes only with the particular user or
            visitor’s permission. Whenever a user or visitor to the SELF Site
            agrees to allow us to collect personal information, we provide that
            person with an option to prevent such information from being shared
            for marketing and promotional purposes with third parties.
            Furthermore, you may exercise this cost-free option at any time by
            emailing us below: Hello@selfplatform.io]
          </p>

          <p>
            Because the SELF Site has a comprehensive privacy policy and
            provides you with details on how you may opt-in or opt-out of the
            use of your personal information by third parties for direct
            marketing purposes, we are not required to provide you with the
            third party list contemplated under California’s Shine the Light
            law.
          </p>
