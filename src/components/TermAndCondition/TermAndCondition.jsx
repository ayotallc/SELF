          </p>

          <p>
            (a) General. The SELF Site may now or in the future permit you and
            other Users to post or link media, text, audio and video recordings,
            photos, graphics, commentary or other information or content ("User
            Content"), and to host and/or share such User Content. User Content
            is not controlled by SELF. SELF makes no representations that your
            User Content will remain available via the SELF Site in any way. We
            may remove your User Content at our sole discretion. YOU UNDERSTAND

            GUARANTEE ANY CONFIDENTIALITY WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUCH USER CONTENT,

          <p>
            (b) Grant of Rights. By submitting User Content to SELF, you hereby
            grant SELF and its affiliates a worldwide, non-exclusive, fully
            paid-up, royalty-free, transferable license, with the right to grant
            and authorize sublicenses, to use, reproduce, distribute, modify,
            adapt, translate, prepare derivative works of, display, perform, and
            otherwise exploit your User Content in connection with the SELF Site
            and SELF's (and its successors, transferees and sublicensees, as
            well as their respective affiliates) business, including without
            limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the SELF
            Site (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through
            any media channels or through merchandising. You grant SELF and its
            affiliates, transferees and sublicensees (and their respective
            affiliates) the right to use the name that you submit in connection
            with such User Content if they choose to do so. You also agree to
            irrevocably waive (and cause to be waived) any claims and assertions
            of moral rights or attribution with respect to your User Content.
            You also hereby grant to each User of the SELF Site a non-exclusive
            license to access your User Content through the SELF Site, and to
            use, reproduce, distribute, modify, adapt, translate, prepare
            derivative works of, display, and perform such User Content as
            permitted by the functionality of the SELF Site and these Terms. The
            above licenses granted by you in User Content you submit to the SELF
            Site shall be perpetual and irrevocable, except that with respect to
            any User Content that you have removed or deleted while maintaining
            your SELF Site user account, or any User Content following any
            deactivation or deletion of your SELF Site user account, you may
            specifically notify SELF regarding the termination of the foregoing
            license from you to SELF, specifically identifying the item(s) of
            User Content to which such termination applies, in which case the
            foregoing license will terminate within a commercially reasonable
            time after you provide such notice to SELF. You understand and
            agree, however, that even following such termination, SELF may
            retain, but not display or perform, server copies of such User
            Content. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the above
            licenses granted by you in user comments you submit are perpetual
            and irrevocable.

            consequences of posting such Content. In connection with User
            Content, you affirm, represent, and/or warrant that: (i) you own, or
            have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to
            use and authorize SELF to use, all patent, trademark, copyright, or
            other proprietary rights in and to any and all User Content to
            enable inclusion and use of User Content in the manner contemplated
            by SELF and these Terms, and to grant the rights and license set
            forth in this Section, and (ii) your User Content, SELF's use of
            such User Content pursuant to these Terms, and SELF's exercise of
            the license rights set forth in this Section, do not and will not:
            (A) infringe, violate, or misappropriate any third-party right,
            including any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, moral
            right, privacy right, right of publicity, or any other intellectual
            property or proprietary right; (B) slander, defame, libel, or invade
            the right of privacy, publicity or other property rights of any
            other person; or (C) violate any applicable law or regulation.
          </p>

          <p>
            (d) Prohibited Uses of User Content. Except as otherwise permitted
            by these Terms, in connection with your User Content, you further
            agree that you will not publish, post, submit, transmit through or
            otherwise make available to the SELF Site : (i) any falsehoods or
            misrepresentations that could damage SELF or any third party; (iii)
            any material which is unlawful, defamatory, libelous, slanderous,
            pornographic, obscene, abusive, profane, vulgar, sexually explicit,
            threatening, harassing, harmful, hateful, racially or ethnically
            offensive or otherwise objectionable, or which encourages conduct
            that would be considered a criminal offense, give rise to civil
            liability, violate any law or any right of privacy or publicity, or
            is otherwise inappropriate; (iv) advertisements or solicitations of
            business, products, or services; or (v) any material that would be
            harmful to minors in any manner.
          </p>

          <p>
            (e) No Responsibility for User Content. With the exception of the
            limited license granted above, we do not obtain or control any
            rights in, and do not exert editorial control over, User Content.
            Nothing herein obligates us to verify, and we have not necessarily
            verified, the representations and warranties made by Users with
            respect to such User Content.
          </p>

          <p>
            7. <b> Third Party Content Disclaimer. </b> You understand that when
            using the SELF Site you will be exposed to User Content, advertising
            and other third party content (together, the "Third Party Content")
            from a variety of sources, and that you may be exposed to Third
            Party Content that is inaccurate, offensive, indecent, or otherwise
            objectionable. SELF does not endorse any Third Party Content or any
            opinion, recommendation, or advice expressed therein. Under no
            circumstances will SELF be liable in any way for or in connection
            with the Third Party Content, including, but not limited to, for any
            inaccuracies, errors or omissions in any Third Party Content, any
            intellectual property infringement or misappropriation with regard
            to any Third Party Content, or for any loss or damage of any kind
            incurred as a result of the use of any Non- SELF Content posted,
            emailed or otherwise displayed or transmitted through the SELF Site.
          </p>

          <p>
            8. <b> Non-Monitoring of Users and Third Party Content. </b> You
            understand that you, and not SELF, are entirely responsible for all
            User Content that you upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise
            make available through the SELF Site. SELF does not control Third
            Party Content posted by Users or otherwise made available by other
            persons or entities and does not have any obligation to monitor such
            Third Party Content for any purpose. If at any time SELF chooses, in
            its sole discretion, to monitor the Third Party Content, SELF
            nonetheless assumes no responsibility for the Third Party Content,
            no obligation to modify or remove any inappropriate Third Party
            Content, no obligation to continue to monitor the Third Party
            Content and no responsibility for the conduct of the User or other
            person or entity submitting any such Third Party Content. You agree
            that you must evaluate, and bear all risks associated with the use
            of any User Content or other Third Party Content, including any
            reliance on the accuracy, completeness, usefulness, non-infringement
            or legality of such User Content or other Third Party Content.
          </p>

          <p>
            9. <b> Removal of Third Party Content. </b> SELF and its designees
            shall have the right (but not the obligation) in their sole
            discretion to refuse to post or remove any Third Party Content that
            is available on the SELF Site, in whole or in part, at any time for
            any reason or no reason, with or without notice and with no
            liability of any kind.
          </p>

          <p>
            10. <b> Prohibited Uses of the SELF Site. </b>

          <p>
            (a) LIMITATIONS BY APPLICABLE LAW. CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS DO NOT
            ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE EXCLUSION OR
            LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES. IF YOU RESIDE IN SUCH A JURISDICTION,
            SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS, OR LIMITATIONS MAY
            NOT APPLY TO YOU, AND YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS. THE
            LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS OF WARRANTIES, REMEDIES, OR LIABILITY
            CONTAINED IN THESE TERMS APPLY TO YOU TO THE FULLEST EXTENT SUCH
            LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS ARE PERMITTED UNDER THE LAWS OF THE
            JURISDICTION IN WHICH YOU ARE LOCATED. IF YOU ARE A USER IN THE
            EUROPEAN UNION, NOTHING IN THESE TERMS ATTEMPTS TO EXCLUDE OR LIMIT
            SELF’S LIABILITY FOR: (A) FRAUD OR FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION; (B)

            OFFERED ITS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND ENTERED INTO THESE TERMS IN
            RELIANCE UPON THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND THE LIMITATIONS OF
            LIABILITY SET FORTH HEREIN, THAT THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND THE
            LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH HEREIN REFLECT A REASONABLE AND
            FAIR ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN YOU AND SELF, AND THAT THE WARRANTY
            DISCLAIMERS AND THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH HEREIN FORM
            AN ESSENTIAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN YOU AND SELF. YOU
            ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT SELF WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE
            SELF SITE TO YOU ON AN ECONOMICALLY REASONABLE BASIS WITHOUT THESE
            LIMITATIONS.

            (a) Infringement Claims. If you are a copyright owner or an agent
            thereof, and believe that any User Content or other Third Party

            ("DMCA") by providing our Copyright Agent with the following
            information in writing (see 17 U.S.C. 512(c)(3) for further detail).
          </p>

          <p>
            (i) A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act
            on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly

          <p>
            (ii) Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been

            URL to all such works;
          </p>

          <p>
            (iii) Identification of the material that is claimed to be
            infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity on the SELF
            Site and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled,
            including the link or URL for all such material on the SELF Site;
          </p>

          <p>
            (iv) Information reasonably sufficient to permit SELF to contact the
            complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if
            available, an electronic mail address at which the complaining party
            may be contacted;
          </p>

          <p>
            (v) A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief
            that use of the material in the manner complained of is not
            authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
          </p>

          <p>
            (vi) A statement that the information in the notification is
            accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party
            is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right
            that is allegedly infringed.

          <p>
            FAILURE TO INCLUDE ALL OF THE ABOVE INFORMATION, ESPECIALLY SPECIFIC
            INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE INFRINGING CONTENT MAY BE FOUND, WILL RESULT
            IN A DELAY IN THE PROCESSING OF YOUR DMCA NOTIFICATION AND MAY
            RESULT IN YOUR HAVING TO REPEAT SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE PROCESS.
          </p>

          <p>
            (b) Notice And Takedown. If we receive proper notification of
            claimed copyright infringement, we will respond expeditiously by
            removing, or disabling access to, the material that is claimed to be
            infringing, as described below, or to be the subject of infringing
            activity. We will also comply with the appropriate provisions of the
            DMCA in the event a counter-notification is received, as described
            below.
          </p>

          <p>
            We may, at our discretion, deny access to the SELF Site by, or
            disable and/or terminate the accounts of, Users who may be
            infringers.
          </p>

          <p>
            (c) Copyright Counter-Notices. If content you posted on the SELF
            Site was removed for copyright or intellectual property
            infringement, and you would like to dispute that removal, the
            process for counter-notifications, which is governed by Section
            512(g) of the DMCA, is as follows:
          </p>

          <p>
            1. To file a counter-notification with us, you must provide our
            Copyright Agent, at the address set forth above, with a written
            communication that sets forth the items specified below.
          </p>

          <p>
            2. Please note that under Section 512(f) of the DMCA, any person who
            knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity was
            removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification may be subject
            to liability. Please also be advised that we enforce a policy that
            provides for the termination, in appropriate circumstances, of the
            accounts of (or access privileges by) Users who are infringers.
            Accordingly, if you are not sure whether certain material infringes
            your copyright or the copyrights of others, we suggest that you
            first contact an attorney.
          </p>

          <p>
            (d) Elements of Counter-Notification. To expedite our ability to
            process your counter- notification, please use the following format
            (including section numbers):
          </p>

          <p>
            1. Identify the specific URLs of (or other information sufficient to
            allow us to identify) material that SELF has removed or to which
            SELF has disabled access.
          </p>

          <p>
            2. Provide your full name, address, telephone number, email address
            and, if you are a registered User, the User name of your SELF
            account.
          </p>

          <p>
            3. Provide a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the
            Southern District of New York and the Federal District Court for the
            judicial district in which your address is located (if your address
            is outside of the U.S.A.), and that you will accept service of
            process from the person who provided notification to our Copyright
            Agent in accordance with the process outlined above, or an agent of
            such person.
          </p>

          <p>
            4. Include the following statement: "I swear, under penalty of
            perjury, that I have a good faith belief that the material was
            removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of
            the material to be removed or disabled."
          </p>

          <p>
            5. Sign the notice. If you are providing notice by email, a scanned
            physical signature or a valid electronic signature will be accepted.
            Send the communication to the following address:
          </p>

          <p>Ehelige@pryorcashmanlp.com</p>

          <p>
            After we receive your counter-notification, we will forward it to
            the party who submitted the original claim of copyright
            infringement. Please note that when we forward the
            counter-notification, it includes any of your Identifying
            Information set forth in the counter-notification. By submitting a
            counter-notification, you consent to having such Identifying
            Information revealed in this way. We will not forward the
            counter-notification to any party other than the original claimant.
          </p>

          <p>
            After we send out the counter-notification, the claimant must then
            notify us within ten (10) days that he or she has filed an action
            seeking a court order to restrain you from engaging in infringing
            activity relating to the material on the SELF Site. If we receive
            such notification, we will be unable to restore the items. If we do
            not receive such notification, we may, but are not obligated to,
            reinstate the disputed item(s).
          </p>

          <p>
            (e) Foreign Counter-Notification: If you reside outside of the
            United States, please understand that filing a counter-notice may
            lead to legal proceedings between you and the complaining party to
            determine ownership. Be aware that there may be adverse legal
            consequences in your country and/or the United States of America if
            you make a false or bad faith allegation by using this process.
            Please also be advised that we enforce a policy that provides for
            the termination in appropriate circumstances of access privileges
            for Users who are infringers. So, if you are not sure whether
            content you posted on the SELF Site is being infringed, or are
            otherwise unsure of whether to file a counter-notification using
            these procedures, we strongly recommend you first contact a lawyer
            knowledgeable in the laws of the United States and the State of New
            York. If you do wish to file a counter-notice, you should follow the
            process set forth above under the heading "Elements of
            Counter-Notification."

            (f) Severability. If any provision of these Terms shall be unlawful,

            and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
